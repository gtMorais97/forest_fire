# forest_fire

Forest fire simulation I did just for fun and also maybe because I'm a pyromaniac?

Simply run it as a python file, you can change the parameters (forest size, forest density, probability of a tree setting an adjacent tree on fire, probability of a tree extinguishing itself) to see behaviour changes.
